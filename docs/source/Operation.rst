Operation
=========


Parameter files
---------------
Parameter files are used to control GLOBSIM. The parameter files follow the TOML standard (https://toml.io/en/). Each step in the procedure (download, interpolate, scale) can be split into its own file, or combined. The important thing is that they always have the appropriate headings (e.g. [download], [interpolate], or [scale]). The parameter files should be in the /par subdirectory of the project directory. 


Downloading
^^^^^^^^^^^


=========================         =============
   **Keyword**                    **Description** 
-------------------------         ------------- 

``project_directory``             This is the full path to the project directory which stores the downloaded files and the control files. It should include a subdirectory called /par which contains parameter files (control files) as well as a csv describing the sites to which data are scaled.
``credentials_directory``         The location of the credential files (e.g. `.merrarc` and `.jrarc`).  Does not apply to credential file .ecmwfapi which defaults to your home directory. It is recommended to set this parameter to your home directory
``chunk_size``                    How many days to include in each download file.  Larger chunk size values mean that a smaller number of files will be downloaded, each with a larger size
``bbN``                           Coordinates for northern boundary of bounding box describing the area for which data will be downloaded.  Coordinates must be in decimal degrees.
``bbS``                           Coordinates for southern boundary of bounding box describing the area for which data will be downloaded. Coordinates must be in decimal degrees.
``bbW``                           Coordinates for western boundary of bounding box describing the area for which data will be downloaded.  Coordinates must be in decimal degrees with negative values for locations west of 0.
``bbE``                           Coordinates for eastern boundary of bounding box describing the area for which data will be downloaded. Coordinates must be in decimal degrees with negative values for locations west of 0.    
``ele_min``                       Minimum elevation that will be downloaded. Recommended to leave at 0.
``ele_max``                       Maximum elevation that will be downloaded. Should be at least 2500.
``beg``                           First date for which data is downloaded YYYY/MM/DD
``end``                           Last date for which data is downloaded YYYY/MM/DD
``variables``                     Which variables should be downloaded from the server. The variables names come from the `CF Standard Names table <http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/59/build/cf-standard-name-table.html>`_.  It is recommended that the variables parameter be left to include all relevant variables: air_temperature, relative_humidity, precipitation_amount, downwelling_longwave_flux_in_air, downwelling_longwave_flux_in_air_assuming_clear_sky, downwelling_shortwave_flux_in_air, downwelling_shortwave_flux_in_air_assuming_clear_sky,  wind_from_direction, wind_speed

Interpolating
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

=========================         ===============
   **Keyword**                    **Description** 
-------------------------         ---------------
``project_directory``             This is the full path to the project directory which stores the downloaded files and the control files. It should include a subdirectory called /par which contains parameter files (control files) as well as a csv describing the sites to which data are scaled. 
``output_directory``              The directory to which interpolated files will be saved. If not provided, or if the directory does not exist, globsim will write to the ``project_directory`` by default. 
``station_list``                  The filename of a csv containing site names and coordinates. If just the filename is specified without a path, globsim will look in the ``par`` folder within the project directory. If a full filepath is used, globsim will use that file instead. Typically the same ``station_list`` file will also be used in the scaling step.
``chunk_size``                    How many time-steps to interpolate at once. This helps memory management. Keep small for large area files and/or computers with little memory. Make larger to get performance improvements on computers with lots of memory.
``beg``                           Beginning of date range for which data will be interpolated in ``YYYY/MM/DD`` format.  Note that this date range must include dates that are represented in the downloaded data.
``end``                           End of date range for which data will be interpolated in ``YYYY/MM/DD`` format.  Note that this date range must include dates that are represented in the downloaded data.
``variables``                     Which variables should be downloaded from the server. The variables names come from the `CF Standard Names table <http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/59/build/cf-standard-name-table.html>`_.  It is recommended that the variables parameter be left to include all relevant variables

Rescaling
^^^^^^^^^

=========================         ===============
   **Keyword**                    **Description** 
-------------------------         ---------------
``project_directory``             This is the full path to the project directory that contains the interpolated files. By default, it contains a subdirectory called /par where site list csv files are kept.
``output_directory``              The directory to which scaled files will be saved. If not provided, or if the directory does not exist, globsim will write to the ``project_directory`` by default. 
``station_list``                  The filename (without path) of csv containing site information such as *sitelist.csv* (note that this must match the interpolation parameter file)
``output_file``                   Path to output netCDF to be created. 
``overwrite``                     Either ``true`` or ``false``. Whether or not to overwrite the ``output_file`` if it exists.
``time_step``                     The desired output time step in hours
``kernels``                       Which processing kernels should be used. Missing or misspelled kernels will be ignored by globsim.

Example Parameter File
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Here is an example of a TOML parameter file with all three sections (download, interpolate, scale) combined into one section.

::

    title = "Globsim Control File"

    [download]
    # logistics
    project_directory = "/opt/globsim/examples/Example1"
    credentials_directory = "/root"

    # chunk size for splitting files and download [days]
    chunk_size = 2

    # area bounding box [decimal degrees]
    bbN = 66
    bbS = 62
    bbW = -112
    bbE = -108

    # ground elevation range within area [m]
    ele_min = 0
    ele_max = 2500

    # time slice [YYYY/MM/DD]
    beg = "2017/07/01"
    end = "2017/07/05"

    # variables to download [CF Standard Name Table]
    variables = ["air_temperature", "relative_humidity", "wind_speed", "wind_from_direction", "precipitation_amount", "downwelling_shortwave_flux_in_air", "downwelling_longwave_flux_in_air", "downwelling_shortwave_flux_in_air_assuming_clear_sky", "downwelling_longwave_flux_in_air_assuming_clear_sky"]

    [interpolate]
    # Path to the parent directory of /par - It should match the download and scale files
    project_directory = "/opt/globsim/examples/Example1"

    # Filename (without path) of csv containing site information (must match scaling control file)
    station_list = "siteslist.csv"

    # How many time steps to interpolate at once? This helps memory management.
    # Keep small for large area files and small memory computer, make larger to get 
    # speed on big machines and when working with small area files.
    # for a small area, we suggest values up to 2000, but consider the memory limit of your computer
    chunk_size = 2000

    # time slice [YYYY/MM/DD] assuming 00:00 hours
    beg = "2017/07/01"
    end = "2017/07/05"

    # variables to interpolate [CF Standard Name Table]
    variables = ["air_temperature", "relative_humidity", "wind_speed", "wind_from_direction", "precipitation_amount", "downwelling_shortwave_flux_in_air", "downwelling_longwave_flux_in_air", "downwelling_shortwave_flux_in_air_assuming_clear_sky", "downwelling_longwave_flux_in_air_assuming_clear_sky"]

    [scale]
    # Path to the parent directory of /par - It should match the download and interpolate files
    project_directory = "/opt/globsim/examples/Example1"

    # Filename (without path) of csv containing site information (must match interpolation control file)
    station_list = "siteslist.csv"

    # processing kernels to be used.  Unavailable kernels will be ignored
    kernels = ["PRESS_Pa_pl", "AIRT_C_pl", "AIRT_C_sur", "PREC_mm_sur", "RH_per_sur", "WIND_sur", "SW_Wm2_sur", "LW_Wm2_sur", "SH_kgkg_sur"]

    # desired time step for output data [hours]
    time_step = 1

    # Should the output file be overwritten if it exists?
    overwrite = true

Station list for interpolation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This is an example of a Globsim station list file. The resulting netCDF file will use the station numbers as identifiers. Use extension like this: 'my_stations.csv'::

     station_number, station_name, longitude_dd, latitude_dd, elevation_m 
     1, yellowknife_airport, -114.44234, 62.46720, 207
     2, ekati_airport, -110.60804, 64.70591, 461
     
     
Project directory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^     
The ``project directory`` is the location to which data is downloaded and where processed data is found. The project directory is subdivided by re-analysis type and by the type of derived product::

     project_a/              (project directory)
     project_a/par/          (parameter files for data download and interpolation)
     project_a/jra-55/       (JRA-55 data)
     project_a/eraint/       (ERA-Interim data)
     project_a/era5/         (ERA5 data)
     project_a/merra2/       (MERRA 2 data)
     project_a/station/      (data interpolated to stations)
     project_a/scale/        (final scaled files)
